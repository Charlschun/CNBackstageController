{"google":"","body":"##Overview\r\n`CNBackstageController` is an derivative of `NSWindowController` and a special impelementation to show you the content you would like to see. The goal of `CNBackstageController` is to provide the developer a slightly different interface for presenting an application.\r\n\r\nIt mimics the behavior youâ€™ve just seen in Notification Center of Mountain Lion. Instead of showing a normal window and menu bar an application build with `CNBackstageController` offer you a behind the Finder-like desktop and will be shown with smooth animations. The common use is an application nested as a statusbar item that is not visible in the Dock.\r\n\r\nHere is a shot of the included example application:\r\n\r\n![CNGridView Example Application](https://dl.dropbox.com/u/34133216/WebImages/Github/CNBackstageController.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n###Status Quo\r\n`CNBackstageController` is a project in progress and far off being feature complete. There may be some errors or misfunctions. So please give me feedback about that. `CNBackstageController` was written using ARC and should run on 10.7 and above.\r\n\r\n\r\n###Documentation\r\nThe documentation of this project is auto generated using [Appledoc](http://gentlebytes.com/appledoc/) by [@gentlebytes](https://twitter.com/gentlebytes).
