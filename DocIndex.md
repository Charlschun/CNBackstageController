#Overview
 `CNBackstageController` is an derivative of `NSWindowController` and a special impelementation to show you the content
 you would like to see. The goal of `CNBackstageController` is to provide the developer a slightly different interface
 for presenting an application. It mimics the behavior you've just seen in Notification Center of Mountain Lion.
 Instead of showing a normal window and menu bar an application build with `CNBackstageController` offer you a *behind the Finder*-like
 desktop and will be shown with smooth animations. The common use is an application nested as a statusbar item that is not
 visible in the Dock.
